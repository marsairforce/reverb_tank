* Hand it in to OSHPark to be made. $74.42

Now waiting for the board to get made and mailed to me.

* Kick off the project.
* Capture schematic from [ESD Project 34](https://sound-au.com/project34.htm)
* Borrow power supply design from op-amp power supply project. Make it a single +/-15V fixed regulator. Super simple stuff here.
* Get to the point where I can start laying things out in pcbnew. But losing steam because its 3 AM.
